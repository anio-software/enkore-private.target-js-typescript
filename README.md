# @enkore-private/target-js-typescript

Wrapper around TypeScript.

Things to improve / consider:

- Clear distinction between AST nodes and symbols (they are kind of mixed right now) - not good!
- Type dependency tree might need to be a graph as well
- I think the dependency graph doesn't work correctly for virtual files?
